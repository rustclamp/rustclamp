# Changelog: rustclamp

## Unreleased

### Added

- Phase 0 package scaffold and development checks.
- Synchronous `Clamp::run` entrypoint and a prelude exporting `Clamp`.
- Pico example, plain Rust comparison, isolated dependency regression checks,
  ownership/error/panic tests, and reproducible cost and allocation measurements.
- Expanded the project README, architecture diagrams, verification guidance,
  measured comparisons, evidence, and release documentation.
- Updated isolated checks to include declared internal dependency closures and
  distinguish package-list validation from registry-dependent archive verification.
- Added colored test/benchmark terminal verdicts, per-benchmark intent text, and
  Phase 2 qualifier, cardinality, and composition-edit measurements.
